    "A typical catkin workspace contains five directories, also called _spaces_: `src/`, `build/`, `logs/`, `devel/`, and `install/`, each serving a different role in the software development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source Space\n",
    "The source space (`src/` directory) contains the source code organized in catkin packages. This is where you add source code for the packages you want to build. Each folder within the source space contains one or more catkin packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build Space\n",
    "The build space (`build/` directory) is where catkin keeps its cache information and other intermediate files that result from the process of building (or compiling) a catkin workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logs Space\n",
    "The logs space (`logs/` directory) is where catkin keeps its logs of the build process. These contain all the `stdout` and `stderr` streams produced during the build process. This data is useful for debugging build errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development (Devel) Space\n",
    "The development space (or devel space, `devel/` directory) is where built artefacts are placed prior to being installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Space\n",
    "Once artefacts are built, they are installed into the install space (`install/` directory). This is where binaries and libraries will be executed/imported from."
